🎨 Event Title: "EduToys: Innovation Through Play"
Theme: Design and Make Educational Toys

Create a toy that helps in learning or understanding a concept (e.g., science, math, language, environment, history, etc.).

🧠 Objective
To encourage creativity and innovation by designing toys that serve an educational purpose—helping children or students learn through play.

📝 General Guidelines
- Participants can be individuals or teams (Max 4 members per team).
- Toys must be safe, non-toxic, and suitable for the age group they are designed for.
- Theme must be educational – Examples:
  • Math puzzle board
  • Solar system model with movable parts
  • Language learning flash toy
  • Historical timeline game
  • Environmental awareness board game
- Toys can be:
  • Manual (no electronics)
  • Or Simple tech-enabled  
- Use of recycled materials is encouraged 

🧩 Rules
- Originality: Toy must be your own idea or a unique twist on an existing one.
- Educational Purpose: It must teach or demonstrate a learning concept clearly.
- Time Limit: You will have 4–6 hours on event day to build or present the toy (prototype/demo model).
- Presentation Time: Each team will get 5–7 minutes to demonstrate how the toy works and what it teaches.
- Materials: Participants should bring their own materials (organizers may provide basic craft supplies upon request).
- Disqualification: Any pre-made toys purchased from stores will lead to disqualification.

🚀 Event Title: "TechNova: Innovations for a Smarter Future"
Theme: Tech Innovations for Society / Education / Environment / Healthcare / Everyday Life


🧠 Objective
Encourage students to design innovative, tech-based solutions that solve real-world problems using creativity, technical knowledge, and engineering skills.

💡 Project Idea Scope
Participants can present prototypes, models, apps, or devices based on (but not limited to) these domains:
- Smart Education Tools (e.g., AI-based learning apps)
- Environmental Tech (e.g., IoT for waste management)
- Assistive Tech for differently-abled people
- Smart Health Devices or Solutions
- Agriculture Automation or Tools
- Smart City / Home Automation
- Drones, Robots, Embedded Systems, etc.

🛠 Project Requirements
- Must include working model or prototype (software or hardware).
- Innovations must focus on real-world impact.
- Participants can use Arduino, Raspberry Pi, AI/ML, Android apps, or web tools.
- No plagiarism – must be your original or uniquely developed solution.

📜 Rules and Guidelines
- Team Size: Individual or team of max 4 members.
- Time Limit:
  • 6 hours for setup, integration, and testing (if building on-site).
  • 7 minutes for final presentation + demo (3 minutes Q&A).
- Pre-prepared projects allowed, but you must explain its development process.
- Participants must bring their own laptops, chargers, boards, sensors, etc.
- Only basic resources (like tables, extension cords) will be provided.
- Projects using AI tools (e.g., ML models, Chatbots) are welcome.
- Dangerous tools or hazardous materials are strictly prohibited.

🧾  Documentation
Each team should submit a Tech Summary Sheet that includes:
- Project Title
- Problem Statement
- Solution & How it Works
- Technologies Used
- Future Scope
- Team Members and College
- Estimated Cost

 


🌍 Event Title: “O3 Shield: Innovation to Protect the Ozone”
Theme: Protecting the Ozone Layer by Reducing CFCs and Promoting Eco-Tech

🧠 Objective
Encourage students to design solutions, campaigns, or technologies that help reduce the emission of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances — through innovation, awareness, or alternative technologies.

⚠ Why It Matters:
CFCs are harmful man-made chemicals used in refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol sprays, and foams.
When released, they break down the ozone (O₃) molecules in the stratosphere.
Ozone layer protects us from harmful UV rays, which cause skin cancer, cataracts, crop damage, and marine ecosystem disruption.

💡 Project Ideas & Topics
Participants can work on models, campaigns, innovations, or digital tools related to:
- Eco-friendly Refrigeration & Cooling Technologies
- Awareness Campaign on CFC Impact
- Apps or Games to Educate about Ozone Protection
- Ozone Impact Sensors / Data Collection Tools
- Green Chemistry Solutions (CFC-free alternatives)
- Miniature Models Showing Ozone Damage & Repair
- DIY Air Purifier Without Harmful Gases
- IoT-based Smart Sprayer that avoids aerosols

📝 General Instructions
Age Group: School (10–15) and College (15–22) with separate categories.
Team Size: Individual or Max 4 per team.
Submission Types Allowed:
- Working Model
- Awareness Poster/Board Game/App
- Campaign Plan or Simulation
- Science Model + Explanation Sheet
Working Time: 4–6 hours onsite / or bring completed project.

🔧 Rules & Guidelines
- Project must relate to CFC reduction or ozone protection.
- Can be a tech project, model, awareness tool, or sustainable invention.
- Must be safe and environmentally friendly (no actual use of gases).
- Must be participant's own work — plagiarism leads to disqualification.
- Must clearly demonstrate the problem and your solution.
- Presentation time: 5–7 minutes including demo + Q&A.

📄 Documentation is optional but encouraged for higher marks:
- Title
- Problem & Solution
- Materials Used
- Learning Outcome
- Team Details
 

✅ How You Can Protect Ozone (Inspiration for Projects)
- Use natural refrigerants instead of CFCs (like propane, ammonia, CO₂)
- Promote aerosol-free lifestyle
- Create apps or games for ozone education
- Design sensor devices to detect air quality or harmful emissions
- Build solar-powered appliances that don't emit CFCs

📌 Additional Notes
- Encourage use of recycled or non-plastic materials in the model.
- Projects with social impact or awareness outreach get bonus points.
- Certificates for all, special awards for best eco-tech solution.
