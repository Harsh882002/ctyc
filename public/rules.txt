🌍 Event Title: “O3 Shield: Innovation to Protect the Ozone”
Theme: Protecting the Ozone Layer by Reducing CFCs(Chlorofluorocarbons) and Promoting Eco-Tech

🧠 Objective
Encourage students to design solutions, campaigns, or technologies that help reduce the emission of CFC(Chlorofluorocarbons) and other ozone-depleting substances — through innovation, awareness, or alternative technologies.

⚠ Why It Matters:
CFC(Chlorofluorocarbons) are harmful man-made chemicals used in refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol sprays, and foams.
When released, they break down the ozone (O₃) molecules in the stratosphere.
Ozone layer protects us from harmful UV rays, which cause skin cancer, cataracts, crop damage, and marine ecosystem disruption.

💡 Project Ideas & Topics
Participants can work on models, campaigns, innovations, or digital tools related to:
- Eco-friendly Refrigeration & Cooling Technologies
- Awareness Campaign on CFC Impact
- Apps or Games to Educate about Ozone Protection
- Ozone Impact Sensors / Data Collection Tools
- Green Chemistry Solutions (CFC-free alternatives)
- Miniature Models Showing Ozone Damage & Repair
- DIY Air Purifier Without Harmful Gases
- IoT-based Smart Sprayer that avoids aerosols

📝 General Instructions
Age Group: College (15–22) with separate categories.
Team Size: Individual or Max 4 per team.
Submission Types Allowed:
- Working Model
- Awareness Poster/Board Game/App
- Campaign Plan or Simulation
- Science Model + Explanation Sheet
Working Time: 4–6 hours onsite / or bring completed project.

🔧 Rules & Guidelines
- Project must relate to CFC reduction or ozone protection.
- Can be a tech project, model, awareness tool, or sustainable invention.
- Must be safe and environmentally friendly (no actual use of gases).
- Must be participant's own work — plagiarism leads to disqualification.
- Must clearly demonstrate the problem and your solution.

📄 Documentation is optional but encouraged for higher marks:
- Title
- Problem & Solution
- Materials Used
- Learning Outcome
- Team Details
 

✅ How You Can Protect Ozone (Inspiration for Projects)
- Use natural refrigerants instead of CFCs (like propane, ammonia, CO₂)
- Promote aerosol-free lifestyle
- Create apps or games for ozone education
- Design sensor devices to detect air quality or harmful emissions
- Build solar-powered appliances that don't emit CFCs

📌 Additional Notes
- Encourage use of recycled or non-plastic materials in the model.
- Projects with social impact or awareness outreach get bonus points.
- Certificates for all, special awards for best eco-tech solution.







🌍 Event Title: “O3 Shield(Civil Engineer): Building for a Better Ozone”

🎯 Theme:
Civil Engineering Approaches to Ozone Layer Protection through Sustainable Construction and Eco-Friendly Practices

🧠 Objective
Inspire civil engineering students to design sustainable infrastructure, materials, and construction practices that contribute to reducing CFC(Chlorofluorocarbons) emissions and protecting the ozone layer.

⚠ Why It Matters
Many traditional construction materials and practices indirectly contribute to ozone depletion.

Foam insulation, certain paints, coatings, and refrigerant-based systems in buildings can release CFCs(Chlorofluorocarbons) or HCFCs(Hydrochlorofluorocarbons).

The ozone layer shields us from UV radiation that harms humans, crops, and ecosystems.

Civil engineers play a crucial role in shaping a greener built environment.

💡 Project Ideas for Civil Engineers
Participants can showcase models, concepts, or awareness strategies related to:

Use of CFC-free insulation materials in building design

Designing eco-friendly building layouts that reduce the need for air-conditioning

Construction practices that minimize use of ozone-depleting materials

Green building models using traditional and natural materials (like mud, bamboo, lime, etc.)

Concept of ventilated buildings with natural airflow (passive cooling)

Awareness campaigns on sustainable construction methods

Model of a green neighborhood promoting ozone-safe materials

Waste management strategies that reduce harmful emissions during demolition/construction

Sustainable roofing and walling materials that lower heat absorption

Role of urban greenery and landscaping in lowering temperature and cooling needs

📝 General Instructions
Eligibility: Open to Civil Engineering students only (Diploma / B.Tech / M.Tech)

Team Size: Individual or up to 4 members per team

Allowed Submissions:

Physical Model or Structure

Poster or Awareness Display

Sustainable Material Sample Showcase

Construction Plan / Design Layout with explanation

Onsite Time Limit: 4–6 hours (or bring a completed project)

🔧 Rules & Guidelines
The project must clearly connect to ozone protection through civil engineering.

Use of safe, non-hazardous, and eco-friendly materials only.

All work must be original and prepared by the team (no plagiarism).

The project should clearly demonstrate the problem and the proposed civil-based solution.
