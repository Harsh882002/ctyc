🌍 Event Title: “O3 Shield: Innovation to Protect the Ozone”
Theme: Protecting the Ozone Layer by Reducing CFCs(Chlorofluorocarbons) and Promoting Eco-Tech

🧠 Objective
Encourage students to design solutions, campaigns, or technologies that help reduce the emission of CFC(Chlorofluorocarbons) and other ozone-depleting substances — through innovation, awareness, or alternative technologies.

⚠ Why It Matters:
CFC(Chlorofluorocarbons) are harmful man-made chemicals used in refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol sprays, and foams.
When released, they break down the ozone (O₃) molecules in the stratosphere.
Ozone layer protects us from harmful UV rays, which cause skin cancer, cataracts, crop damage, and marine ecosystem disruption.

💡 Project Ideas & Topics
Participants can work on models, campaigns, innovations, or digital tools related to:
- Eco-friendly Refrigeration & Cooling Technologies
- Awareness Campaign on CFC Impact
- Apps or Games to Educate about Ozone Protection
- Ozone Impact Sensors / Data Collection Tools
- Green Chemistry Solutions (CFC-free alternatives)
- Miniature Models Showing Ozone Damage & Repair
- DIY Air Purifier Without Harmful Gases
- IoT-based Smart Sprayer that avoids aerosols

📝 General Instructions
Age Group: College (10–22) with separate categories.
Team Size: Individual or Max 4 per team.
Submission Types Allowed:
- Working Model
- Awareness Poster/Board Game/App
- Campaign Plan or Simulation
- Science Model + Explanation Sheet
Working Time: 4–6 hours onsite / or bring completed project.

🔧 Rules & Guidelines
- Project must relate to CFC reduction or ozone protection.
- Can be a tech project, model, awareness tool, or sustainable invention.
- Must be safe and environmentally friendly (no actual use of gases).
- Must be participant's own work — plagiarism leads to disqualification.
- Must clearly demonstrate the problem and your solution.

📄 Documentation is optional but encouraged for higher marks:
- Title
- Problem & Solution
- Materials Used
- Learning Outcome
- Team Details
 

✅ How You Can Protect Ozone (Inspiration for Projects)
- Use natural refrigerants instead of CFCs (like propane, ammonia, CO₂)
- Promote aerosol-free lifestyle
- Create apps or games for ozone education
- Design sensor devices to detect air quality or harmful emissions
- Build solar-powered appliances that don't emit CFCs

📌 Additional Notes
- Encourage use of recycled or non-plastic materials in the model.
- Projects with social impact or awareness outreach get bonus points.
- Certificates for all, special awards for best eco-tech solution.







🌍 Event Title: “O3 Shield(Civil Engineer): Building for a Better Ozone”

🎯 Theme:
Civil Engineering Approaches to Ozone Layer Protection through Sustainable Construction and Eco-Friendly Practices

🧠 Objective
Inspire civil engineering students to design sustainable infrastructure, materials, and construction practices that contribute to reducing CFC(Chlorofluorocarbons) emissions and protecting the ozone layer.

⚠ Why It Matters
Many traditional construction materials and practices indirectly contribute to ozone depletion.

Foam insulation, certain paints, coatings, and refrigerant-based systems in buildings can release CFCs(Chlorofluorocarbons) or HCFCs(Hydrochlorofluorocarbons).

The ozone layer shields us from UV radiation that harms humans, crops, and ecosystems.

Civil engineers play a crucial role in shaping a greener built environment.
